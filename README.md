# jsfile

Very small GopherJS app to demonstrate local file manipulation in the browser.

The webapp allows you to "upload" a file, the content gets converted to uppercase and "download" the result, all done locally in the browser.

To check it out just serve it through gopherjs:
```
gopherjs serve
```
    
And navigate to http://localhost:8080/github.com/reusing-code/jsfile/ (URL depends on the location of the source files in relation to the GOPATH.)
